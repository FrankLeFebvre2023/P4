		<p id="website-guide">This website is designed to be a hub for people who are interested in the developing world of Artificial Intelligence. On our Home Page, we show the top stories of the day, and we hope to integrate more features there soon. On our Stories page, we maintain a collection of many news articles and blog posts about AI. Currently, you can search through these articles by keywords, but soon you will be able to sort and filter these articles as well. Our Forum page, though a work in progress, allows users to post about their opinions, ideas, and discuss recent events surrounding AI. Finally, our Contact page allows users to give us feedback or offer suggestions to the authors of the site.</p>

	<div id="mission-div">
		<p id="mission-statement">As AI technology grows more advanced and comes to be involved in more and more aspects of daily life, we believe that it is important for people to learn more about it. We decided to make this website for a few different reasons. Firstly, we wanted to provide a place for people to become educated on AI, its benefits, and its dangers. Secondly, we wanted to provide a place for hobbyists and professionals alike to collaborate. Finally, we wanted to create a one-stop-shop for all things AI-related.</p>
